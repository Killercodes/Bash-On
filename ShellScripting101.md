## How can i define variable 
Variables can be defiend without a keyword, atlhough it must start from letters and are case sensetive as follows
Do make sure that there should be no spaces between the variable and the value 
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
 
x=10            #NOT x = 10 no spaces
X=20            #variables are case sensitive
```

## How can i define a null
Extending the same example above you can define a `null` by not providing any valuees to it as
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
 
x=10            #NOT x = 10 no spaces
X=20            #variables are case sensitive
$y=             #NULL variable
```

## How to redirect the output to a file or something
It follows the same rule of the dos commands 
Command | Description
----|----
`>`| To output Linux-commands result to file.
`>>`| To output Linux-commands result to END of file.
`<`| To take input to Linux-command from file instead of keyboard.

See the below example to clear out your mind
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
clear # clear screen
echo "ls > flist will put the output from ls to a file called flist"
ls > flist
 
echo "ls -la >> flist will append the output to the end of the file flist"
ls -la >> flist
 
echo "cat < flist will input all the text in the file flist into the cat command "
cat < flist
```
